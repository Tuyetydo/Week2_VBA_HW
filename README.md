# Week2_VBA_HW

## Overview of Project
Steve is a recent graduate with a finance degree and his parents proudly volunteered to be his first clients. They specifically want to invest in green energy and more specifically, they selected DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ) because of the connection that his parents met at Dairy Queen. But before approving any further actions, Steve pulled together a spreadsheet containing the stock data regarding other green energy stocks to have me analyze. I created the workbook for him with the initial VBA and he loved it but is now looking to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years as well as reducing the time to execute it.  


### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a refactored VBA workbook for Steve to use and analyze in a reasonable timeframe.  The requested deliverables to be provided to Steve are:

- [x] Deliverable 1: Refactor VBA code and measure performance
- [x] Deliverable 2: A written analysis of my results

## Results and Summary

### Performance Results
The quickest benchmark to compare if the refactoring reduced the execution times, is by comparing the run times between the codes. Below is a comparison of the 2017 pre and post refactoring run times. The pre time shows that the code ran in 1.15 seconds while the post time shows that the code ran in 0.13 seconds. The difference of 1.02 seconds which is almost 89% less run time.

Below is a comparison of the 2018 pre and post refactoring run times. The pre time shows that the code ran in 1.17 seconds while the post time shows that the code ran in 0.13 seconds. The difference of 1.04 seconds which is almost 89% less run time.

### Summary
Based on the performance results, specifically the run times. It's easily seen the advantage of refactoring code with a reduced run time of 89%. At the same, refactoring code has a disadvantage of more time to adjust the code but ultimately it paid off in this example.
